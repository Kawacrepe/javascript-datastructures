# Javascript datastructures


# Why 

I wanted to study differents algorithms and how they can be implemented in javascript (because we love javascript), then I encountered a problem.

There is no javascript library which help us work with datastructures.
The only one is [Bucket.js](https://github.com/mauriciosantos/Buckets-JS)

Then I saw an opportunity to show some understanding of datastructures and algorithms.
